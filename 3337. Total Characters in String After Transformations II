3337. Total Characters in String After Transformations II

You are given a string s consisting of lowercase English letters, an integer t representing the number of transformations to perform, and an array nums of size 26. In one transformation, every character in s is replaced according to the following rules:

Replace s[i] with the next nums[s[i] - 'a'] consecutive characters in the alphabet. For example, if s[i] = 'a' and nums[0] = 3, the character 'a' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "bcd".
The transformation wraps around the alphabet if it exceeds 'z'. For example, if s[i] = 'y' and nums[24] = 3, the character 'y' transforms into the next 3 consecutive characters ahead of it, which results in "zab".
Return the length of the resulting string after exactly t transformations.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcyy", t = 2, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]

Output: 7

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'b' as nums[0] == 1
'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
'y' becomes 'z' as nums[24] == 1
String after the first transformation: "bcdzz"
Second Transformation (t = 2):

'b' becomes 'c' as nums[1] == 1
'c' becomes 'd' as nums[2] == 1
'd' becomes 'e' as nums[3] == 1
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
String after the second transformation: "cdeabab"
Final Length of the string: The string is "cdeabab", which has 7 characters.

Example 2:

Input: s = "azbk", t = 1, nums = [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]

Output: 8

Explanation:

First Transformation (t = 1):

'a' becomes 'bc' as nums[0] == 2
'z' becomes 'ab' as nums[25] == 2
'b' becomes 'cd' as nums[1] == 2
'k' becomes 'lm' as nums[10] == 2
String after the first transformation: "bcabcdlm"
Final Length of the string: The string is "bcabcdlm", which has 8 characters.


SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE PROBLEM:


#JAVA CODE: 

class Solution {
    private final int mod = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int lengthAfterTransformations(String s, int t, List<Integer> nums) {
        final int m = 26;

        int[] cnt = new int[m];

            for (int j = 1; j <= num; j++) {
                matrix[i][(i + j) % m] = 1;
            }
        }

            for (int k = 0; k < p; k++) {
                if (a[i][k] == 0) continue;
                for (int j = 0; j < q; j++) {
                    res[i][j] = (int) ((res[i][j] + 1L * a[i][k] * b[k][j]) % mod);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    private int[][] matpow(int[][] mat, int power, int m) {

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            res[i][i] = 1;
        }
        while (power > 0) {
            if ((power & 1) != 0) {
                res = matmul(res, mat);
            }
            mat = matmul(mat, mat);
            power >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }

    private int[] vectorMatrixMultiply(int[] vector, int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                sum = (sum + 1L * vector[j] * matrix[j][i]) % mod;
            }
            result[i] = (int) sum;
        }
        return result;
    }
