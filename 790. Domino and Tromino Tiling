790. Domino and Tromino Tiling

You have two types of tiles: a 2 x 1 domino shape and a tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.


Given an integer n, return the number of ways to tile an 2 x n board. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

In a tiling, every square must be covered by a tile. Two tilings are different if and only if there are two 4-directionally adjacent cells on the board such that exactly one of the tilings has both squares occupied by a tile.

 

Example 1:


Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are show above.
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

SOLUTION OF THE ABOVE PROBLEM:

#JAVA CODE

class Solution {
    public int numTilings(int n) {
           int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;

        long a = 1; // dp[0]
        long b = 1; // dp[1]
        long c = 2; // dp[2]

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            long temp = (2 * c % MOD + a) % MOD;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            c = temp;
        }

        return (int) c;
    }
}
